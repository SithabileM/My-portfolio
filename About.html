<h1>About Me</h1>
<section>
  <div>
    I'm <strong>Sithabile Monde</strong>, a self-taught web developer from Zimbabwe. My journey started in high school with a random click on a Delphi tutorial video. I still remember the thrill of changing a button’s color — a small moment that sparked a lasting love for tech.

    Without formal training and a laptop, I began learning how to code using my phone before I owned a laptop. I used mobile apps, offline IDEs, and free resources like CS50, Sololearn, and Enki — often walking long distances just to charge my device or buy data. I skipped comfort, sleep, and fun just to make space for growth.

    Despite these challenges, I built three full-stack projects from scratch — including a real-time chat app, a school reporting system, and an e-commerce site. I taught myself how to use Django, React, REST APIs, Supabase, and PostgreSQL, and I’ve deployed them all live.

    What drives me is the belief that tech can solve real problems — especially in places where it's needed most. I'm now looking for internship opportunities to grow in a professional team, keep learning, and continue building tools that matter.
