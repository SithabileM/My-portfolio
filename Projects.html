        <h2>1. Monde(E-Commerce application)</h2>
        <img class="portfolioImage" src="Monde.png" alt='e-commerce website'/></br>

<h3>Stack used</h3>
<ul>
          <li>Django</li>
          <li>Supabase</li>
          <li>Render</li>
</ul></br>
 <h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>This was the first web app I ever built, and it taught me the foundational concepts of how websites work — from how servers and clients communicate through HTTP methods to building dynamic web pages using Django and its ORM. I also learned how to structure HTML and style pages with CSS to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience.</p></br>

<h3>Challenges I Faced</h3>
<p>This being my first project, it came with many challenges. I was applying new concepts for the first time, so the process was slow and filled with learning curves. One major hurdle was handling image uploads locally and then figuring out how to host those files during deployment. With persistent research—Googling, watching YouTube tutorials—I eventually figured it out.

Initially, I deployed the app on Railway, not realizing it had a trial period. When the trial expired, I redeployed on Render and Supabase for the database.

Despite the setbacks, this was a rewarding experience. It was my first time building and successfully deploying a fully functional website.</p></br>

        <h2>2. Let's Chat(Full stack chat application)</h3></br>
        <img class="portfolioImage" src="ChatApp.jpg" alt='Chat app website'/>

<h3>Stack used</h3>
<ul>
          <li>React.js</li>
          <li>Djangorestframework</li>
          <li>Supabase</li>
          <li>Render</li>
          <li>Vercel</li>
</ul></br>

   <h3>What I learned</h3>
<p>This app taught me the importance of separation of concerns. Before this, I only knew how to build monolithic Django applications, but I wanted to challenge myself by separating the backend from the frontend. Through this project, I learned how to build and consume REST APIs, and how to integrate them into a React frontend. I also gained experience deploying the Django REST API on Render and the React frontend on Vercel, and connecting the two successfully.</p></br>
   <h3>Challenges I faced</h3>
   <p>I had some experience with Supabase from a previous project, but I initially thought image uploads had to be handled entirely from the backend. This approach quickly became messy. Eventually, I learned that handling uploads from the frontend was much simpler and more efficient. It took some research and trial-and-error, but I got it working. Creating the API endpoints was also a learning curve, but I eventually got the hang of it.
   Unfortunately, Render's database had a trial, which eventually expired. By then, I had already used my free Supabase quota on other projects. As a result, I switched back to using SQLite for this project.</p>

<h2>3. StudentTrack(Mark Tracking and recording application)</h2>
<img class="portfolioImage" src="StudentTrack.jpg" alt='StudentTrack website'/></br>
<h3>Stack used</h3>
<ul>
          <li>Django</li>
          <li>Supabase</li>
          <li>Render</li>
</ul></br>
<h3>What I learned </h3>
<p>This project introduced me to role-based authentication and implementing protected routes for different user types (admin, teacher, student). </p></br>

<h3>Challenges I faced</h3>
<p>Setting up a PostgreSQL database on Supabase was the toughest part. I struggled with which URI to use and initially used one that wasn’t compatible with the free plan. Eventually, I figured out I needed to use the pooler URI. Beyond that, this was the smoothest and most straightforward of my three projects.</p></br>
